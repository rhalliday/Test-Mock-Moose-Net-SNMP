Test-Mock-Net-SNMP version 1.01
===============================

This module is an attempt to mock David M Town's Net::SNMP module. It is 
intended that a user of this module can easily set up mock return
values for the methods provided in Net::SNMP. It should also make
it easy to ensure that the code calling the methods is calling
them with the intended arguments.

This module also provides the ability to test how your code reacts
to Net::SNMP errors.

This module utilizes chromatic's Test::MockObject::Extends to perform
the mocking of Net::SNMP.
